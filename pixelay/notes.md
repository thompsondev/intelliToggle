# Pixelay Comparison Notes

## Desktop Overlay (`pixelay-desktop.png`)
- **Font differences**: Using system fonts (Arial/Helvetica) instead of custom Figma fonts may cause slight text rendering differences
- **Spacing**: Overall layout spacing matches closely; minor pixel-level differences may exist in padding/margins
- **Assets**: Some images used instead of actual dashboard screenshots; colors and layout structure match design intent

## Mobile Overlay (`pixelay-mobile.png`)
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Mobile menu toggle implemented; layout reflows correctly on smaller screens
- **Typography**: Font sizes scale appropriately; line heights may vary slightly from Figma specifications
- **Touch targets**: Interactive elements sized appropriately for mobile interaction

- Color scheme matches Figma design (purple #4A148C, orange #FF6B35, yellow #FFB84D)

- Comparison table uses semantic HTML for accessibility
